          <p>Inspired by an accounting student turned Data Scientist, <em>Ken Jee,</em> i had since embarked into the learning of Data Science. I, like most of those wannabe data scientist finds it hard to know where to start learning. I relied mostly on Ken Jee's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KenJee1"><strong>Youtube Channel</strong></a>.</p>
          <p>So the first steps I took was to learn Python first,and get myself familiar with the language and at the same time to brush up on the mathematics part of Data Science, then a few machine learning courses to go along with it, I'll just pick one or two which sparks my interest.</p>    
          <h3>Skills I will focus on first</h3>
          <ul class="python">
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Data Visualisation</li>
            <li>Mathematics</li>

          <h3><em>folklore</em> album</h3>

          <p>The song narrates a <em>bittersweet memory</em> of a love that she hoped for but never was there.</p>
          <p>Just like many of the songs on that project, this song emits a huge amount of youthful romance and love. However, this particular one narrows things down a little bit to a specific theme of romance during the summer. And as we all know, the month of August is one of the summer months. It is for this reason that Taylor titled the song after the summer month in question.</p>
          <p>In all, this song finds the speaker taking a walk down memory lane and reminiscing heavily over memories of a youthful love in the summer. And despite the romance not lasting very long, it is clear that the memories of the love are cherished and missed greatly by the singer.</p>
          <p>
            <q>August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
            â€˜Cause it was never mine</q></p>
